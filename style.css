/*
    Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

    Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.

When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.

A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.

A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.

When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, 
a Bootstrap alert or similar Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner.
